# Speculative-Validation-for-LLM-Based-Task-Planning
This project implements and evaluates language model-based planners for household task execution, replicating and extending the work of Huang et al. (ICML 2022). We demonstrate that injecting world state context into LLM prompts significantly improves plan executability and correctness compared to zero-shot baselines.
